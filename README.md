## Notes

* I had trouble with using the setOnClickListener: the Android Studio kept throwing an error, despite the fact that my code was identical to the tutorial. Browsing through the StackOverflow and Kotlin Documentation was helpful at resolving the issue. View.onClickListener{} was necessary before the Log.v() command.
